# Support

For questions, comments, concerns, feature suggestions, etc, [feel free to open
an issue](https://github.com/zgulde/cods/issues/new).

I'd appreciate it if you took a look at the documentation before opening an
issue, as I've spent a fair amount of time on it, but I'd also be happy to have
your thoughts on the state of the documentation, or what could be improved.

In an issue, please be as detailed as possible; for example if you think you
found a bug, explain under what conditions the bug appears, and include any
relevant terminal output or log files. This will help me solve the issue
quicker.
