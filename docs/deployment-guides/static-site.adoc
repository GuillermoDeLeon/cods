== Static Site

This section will walk you through creating and deploying a static site with
`cods`.
A prerequisite for this guide is a server command setup with cods, we will
assume the command is named `+myserver+`.
This guide is written for a "plain" static site, that is, a site where the
contents of the repository should just be served to the public and there is no
backend or build process.

=== Create The Site

This section will walk you through creating a (*_very_*) basic static
site and initializing a git repository. Skip this section if you have an
existing project you want to deploy.

. Create an `+index.html+` file.

--
You site could be more complex, but letâ€™s start by creating an
`+index.html+` file. This will be the home page for your domain.

[source,html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello From Cods!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
----
--
. Initialize the git repository
+
....
git init
git add index.html
git commit -m 'First Commit'
....
. (Optionally) push your repository up to GitHub.
+
Go to https://github.com/new[github.com/new] and create a repo, then add
the remote and push.
+
....
git remote add origin ...
git push origin master
....

=== Create The Site

Next we will setup your server to host the site. Run the command below:

....
myserver site create --domain example.com --static
....

replacing `+example.com+` with your domain name (or a subdomain).

=== Push To Deploy

After the site creation command above finishes, you should see some
output that gives you a copy-pastable `+git+` command to add a
`+production+` remote to your repository.

Alternatively, you can find this command by running

....
myserver info --domain example.com
....

Either way after running the command to add the production remote, go
ahead and push:

....
git push production master
....

After pushing, you should see your site live!
