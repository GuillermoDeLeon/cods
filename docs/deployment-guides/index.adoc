== Deployment Guides

This section contains step-by-step walkthroughs for common deployment scenarios.

All of these guides assume the following:

* <<initial-server-setup, A server setup with cods>>
* <<dns-configuration, DNS records properly configured>>
* A working application
+
That is, your application should run locally and be free from errors.

Further, we assume that your server command is named `myserver`.
