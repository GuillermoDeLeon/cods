== What is this?

`cods` is a tool for automatically setting up a cloud server and managing
various applications deployed on that server.

For setup and management of a single remote server and virtual hosting
with nginx, which serves mostly as a reverse proxy to application
servers that (optionally) talk to a mysql database.

If you want to quickly deploy your application on the same server that
hosts your database and not worry about the infastructure details that
entails, this project can help you out.

Primarily, this tool is intended to be used by http://codeup.com[Codeup]
students going through the Java program.
You might also find this project useful if you have a Java, Python, PHP, or Node
web application you want to deploy quickly, or if you want to host several hobby
projects on the same server.

This project is probably *not* for you if:

* You want to use a database that is not MySQL
* You donâ€™t want to put nginx in front of your application
* You want to use an operating system that is not Debian on your server
