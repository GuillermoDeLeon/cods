=== The `+cods+` command

==== `+init+`

The `+init+` subcommand is used to provision a server and setup a local
server command. The server must be ``fresh'' (i.e. not setup by any
other provisioning tools), and you must have root ssh access to the
server.

The name of the server command bust be provided, then any optional
arguments.

*Arguments*

* `+-i+` or `+--ip+`: (optional) the ip address of the server. If not
provided, you will be prompted for it.
* `+-u+` or `+--user+`: (optional) the username to setup for yourself on
the server. If not provided, you will be prompted for it.
* `+-e+` or `+--email+`: (optional) your email address. If note
provided, you will be prompted for it.
* `+--root-user+`: username of the user that has root access to the
server. Defaults to `+root+`.

*Examples*

* Create a command named `+myserver+`
+
....
cods init myserver
....
+
You will be prompted for the server’s ip address, a username for
yourself, and your email address.
* Create a command named `+myserver+`
+
....
cods init myserver --ip 123.123.123.123 --user codeup --email info@codeup.com
....
+
Here you will *not* be prompted for the server’s ip address, a username
for yourself, and your email address because they were provided as
command line arguments.
* Create a `+myserver+` command using a different root user for the
initial setup
+
....
cods init myserver --root-user debian
....

==== `+add+`

The `+add+` subcommand is used to create a local server command for an
existing server. You will need to have ssh access to an existing user
account on the server.

You might use this command if:

* you want to get access to a shared server that your teammate setup and
gave you an account on
* you want to be able to access from your desktop pc a server that you
setup on your laptop

The name of the server command bust be provided, then any optional
arguments.

*Arguments*

* `+-i+` or `+--ip+`: (optional) the ip address of the server. If not
provided, you will be prompted for it.
* `+-u+` or `+--user+`: (optional) the username to setup for yourself on
the server. If not provided, you will be prompted for it.

*Examples*

* Create a command named `+myserver+`
+
....
cods add myserver
....
+
You will be prompted for the server’s ip address and your username.
* Create a command named `+myserver+`
+
....
cods init myserver --ip 123.123.123.123 --user codeup --email info@codeup.com
....
+
Here you will *not* be prompted for the server’s ip address or your
username for yourself because they were provided as command line
arguments.

==== `+update+`

Updates any existing server commands to the most recent version of the
`+cods+` scripts.

You should run this after you update `+cods+`.

*Example*

....
cods update
....

==== `+help+`

Launch the interactive help system.

*Example*

....
cods help
....

=== `+myserver+` - A Command Created By Cods

While `+cods+` can create commands with any name, for the rest of this
document we will assume we are working with a command named
`+myserver+`.

`+myserver+` contains various subcommands for performing different
activities on the server.

To see all the available subcommands, run the `+myserver+` command
without any arguments:

....
myserver
....

The same applies for the `+site+`, `+user+`, and `+db+` subcommands, to
see their available subcommands, just run them by themselves:

....
myserver site
myserver db
myserver user
....

Any subcommands that require arguments can be run without arguments to
see detailed help for the command.

All command line arguments have a long form, and most have a short form
as well. You can pass command line arguments in one of 3 ways:

....
-a value
--arg value
--arg=value
....

==== General Server Commands

===== `+info+`

Show general information about the server. Another argument can be
passed to show just the server’s ip address, or just the remote
username.

*Example*

* Show general information
+
....
myserver info
....
* Show the server’s ip address
+
....
myserver info ip
....
* Show the remote username
+
....
myserver info user
....

===== `+login+`

Launch an interactive shell logged in to your server

*Example*

....
myserver login
....

===== `+ports+`

Show the ports that are currently in use by sites that are setup on the
server.

*Example*

....
myserver ports
....

This will output something like the following:

....
8000 example.com
5000 blog.example.com
....

Where the number to the left of the domain indicates the port that the
site’s application is running on.

===== `+ping+`

Pings the server

===== `+swapon+`

Enable a swap file on the server. You may need to do this if you are
using a lower-end droplet and are getting out of memory errors.

*Example*

....
myserver swapon
....

===== `+autorenew+`

Setup all https certificates to be automatically renewed.

....
myserver autorenew
....

This will setup a cron-job that will have the letsencrypt client renew
any certificates that need to be renewed.

It is safe to run this command multiple timesl if the cron job is
already setup, it will do nothing.

===== `+reboot+`

Reboot the server

===== `+run+`

Run arbitrary command on the server.

*Examples*

* Edit a file on the server with `+nano+`
+
....
myserver run nano /srv/example.com/application.properties
....
* Edit the nginx configuration for a site with `+nano+`
+
....
myserver run sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
....
* View the running processes on the server
+
....
myserver run htop
....
* View the current time on the server
+
....
myserver run date
....

===== `+pipe+`

Run a command on the server in a non-interactive environment (a pty will
_not_ be allocated). This can be useful for transferring binary data to
the server.

===== `+credentials+`

View the credentials file for your server. This file contains all the
autogenerated usernames and passwords for this server.

You can also use this command to view the location of the credentials
file or modify it.

*Examples*

* View the autogenerated credentials
+
....
myserver credentials
....
* View the path to the credentials file, i.e. where the file is located
on your laptop
+
....
myserver credentials path
....
* Edit the credentials file
+
....
myserver credentials edit
....
+
The editor that the file is opened in is based on the `+EDITOR+`
environment variable.
* Add another entry to the credentials file
+
....
myserver credentials add myuser: password123
....
+
Anything after the word `+add+` will be appended to the credentials
file.

===== `+destroy+`

Remove the server command from your laptop. This command will destroy
any knowledge `+cods+` has about the server locally, including any
database backups.

Before destroying the server, you will need to type a confirmation
message so that the process cannot happen accidentaly.

Note that this _will not_ remove the VPS you created on Digital Ocean
(or other hosting provider).

===== `+switch-java-version+`

Change the version of java that is running on the server. At the time of
writing the choices are the 2 LTS java versions, 8 and 11.

*Example*

....
myserver switch-java-version
....

You will be presented with a menu where you can choose the number that
corresponds to the java installation you wish to use.

===== `+bash-completion+`

Outputs bash shell code that can be used to enable tab completion for
the `+myserver+` command. You shouldn’t really run this command
directly, but rather, evaluate it’s output.

*Example*

Running the code below will enable tab completion for the current
terminal session:

....
eval "$(myserver bash-completion)"
....

Now type:

....
myserver <TAB><TAB>
....

You will notice that all subcommands and any command arguments will be
autocompleted.

To make this tab completion persistent, add the line above with `+eval+`
to your `+~/.bash_profile+` (or `+~/.bashrc+` if you’re on Linux) file.

===== `+upload+`

Upload a file from your laptop to the server.

Optionally specify a destination, otherwise will default to your home
directory.

*Arguments*

* `+-f+` or `+--file+`: path to the file to upload
* `+-d+` or `+--destination+`: (optional) destination for the file on
the server

*Examples*

* Upload the `+mycat.png+` file in your downloads directory to the
`+uploads+` folder within the `+public+` directory for `+example.com+`
+
....
myserver upload -f ~/Downloads/mycat.png -d /srv/example.com/public/uploads/mycat.png
....
* Upload a migration SQL script to your server using a relative file
path
+
....
myserver upload --file=migration.sql
....
* Upload a seeder SQL script using an absolute file path
+
....
myserver upload --file ~/IdeaProjects/blog/seeder.sql
....

===== `+restart+`

Restart a service that is running on the server.

*Arguments*

* `+-s+` or `+--service+`: name of the service to restart

*Example*

Restart the `+nginx+` service

....
myserver restart --service nginx
....

==== `+site+` Commands for site management

Enable https for a site.

Before running this command, you should make sure that the DNS records
for your domain are configured to point to your server, otherwise this
command _will_ fail.

On running this command, an https certificate will be obtained using
letsencrypt, and your site will be setup to be served only over https
(i.e. not http.)

* watch the log file for example.com in real-time
+
....
myserver site logs -d example.com -f
....
* save the logs for `+example.com+` to a file named `+example.com.log+`
+
....
myserver site logs --domain example.com > example.com.log
....

can specify a path for the database backup or it will default to
`+~/.config/cods/myserver/db-backups/DATE-DB-backup.sql+`. Where
`+DATE+` and `+DB+` are replaced with the current date/time and database
name, respectively.

*Arguments*

* `+-n+` or `+--name+`: name of the database to backup
